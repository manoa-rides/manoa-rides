        Do you have trouble getting a ride to or from school?
        <br />
        Or perhaps you have a car but wish you could use the HOV lane, have access to carpooling parking, or maybe just sell a seat for breakfadt or coffee?
        <br />
        <br />
        Well, if you answered "Yes!" to either of those questions, then Manoa Rides is for you!
        This app seeks to pair drivers and riders who commute to and from the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you create your profile (a UH email address will be required) then you can search for drivers, riders, or both that live near you!
        <br />
        <br />
        Drivers and riders are encouraged to decide on their own forms of payment or incentive for the drivers to go out of their ways to pick up or drop off riders. Some drivers may be happy to offer their rides without addedd incentives, while others may ask for gasy money, snacks, or maybe a funny story!
